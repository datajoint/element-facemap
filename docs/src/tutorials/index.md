# Tutorials

+ Element Facemap includes an [interactive tutorial on GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/datajoint/element-facemap#interactive-tutorial), which is configured for users to run the pipeline.

+ DataJoint Elements are modular and can be connected into a complete pipeline.  In the interactive tutorial is an example Jupyter notebook that combines four DataJoint Elements - Lab, Animal, Session, and Facemap.  The notebook describes the pipeline and provides instructions for running the pipeline.  For convenience, these notebook is also rendered on this website:

## Installation Instructions for Active Projects

+ The Element Facemap described above can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements and thereby used in active projects.  

+ The GitHub Codespace and Dev Container is configured for tutorials and prototyping.  
We recommend users to configure a database specifically for production pipelines.  Instructions for a local installation of the integrated development environment with a database can be found on the [User Guide](https://docs.datajoint.com/elements/user-guide/) page.
